# Game-Dev-Example

### Description
This is a simple game: you're a square on the left side of the screen, which you can move by clicking on the left side, and if you click on the right side it shoots a bullet. Your goal is to destroy the target (the red square).    
  
I used a lot of stack overflow and answers on Unity to figure out how everything worked, but I had to figure out how to make everything work together, get the cube to move only when you click on the left side and shoot only on the right side, and get the bounce off of the rectangles to work just right.

### How to set it up
Just download the included .zip, extract it, and click on the application.

### How to build
It's already built, ready to go.
